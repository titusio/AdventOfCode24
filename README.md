# Advent of Code 2024

These are the solutions for the Advent of Code challenges 2024.

## How to run

Since it is not allowed to redistribute the input files, you will have to download them yourself from the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2024). 
Create a folder called `Input` in the root directory of the solution. Then place the input file named `DayXX.txt` where `XX` stands for the date. For example, the 12th puzzle would have `Day12.txt` as it's input file.
After you inserted the input file, you can run

```bash
# replace XX the day you want to run.
cd ./DayXX
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
